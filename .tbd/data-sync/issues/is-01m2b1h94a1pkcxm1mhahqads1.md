CAL-6 from the Astra Max source-distinct review. Completed calibration records may omit all CPU observations and pass with one preflight RSS sample, while the baseline and end observations needed to interpret differences are not retained. Define and enforce terminal CPU and minimum RSS coverage, retain the observation scope and missing intervals, validate ordering against invocation lifetime, and preserve the stated sampling and shared-page limits. This is operational admission evidence only and cannot bound BC329 search time.

## Notes

Source-distinct review at `d924a4bf` accepted the CPU reconstruction and most RSS accounting, then found the implementation only requires two total error-free samples and one positive maximum, while the document claims two positive samples. One positive and one zero observation passes. The next repair must enforce two positive observations or weaken and independently admit the contract consistently. Review: `/private/tmp/bc329-calibration-integrated-correction-review.md`. No profile or target ran.
