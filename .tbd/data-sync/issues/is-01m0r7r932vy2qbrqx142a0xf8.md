Unify the existing gate timing history on think-l3ds with reproducible end-to-end measurements of the normal gate, strict/deep gate, candidate generation, quench, overlap testing, canonicalization, certification, visualization preparation, ledger reconciliation, and agent idle time. Pre-register representative cold and warm workloads and repeat counts before tuning.

Acceptance: a versioned benchmark artifact records hardware, revision, commands, workload identities, raw samples, medians and dispersion; imports rather than duplicates think-l3ds evidence; attributes cost by stage; identifies the top throughput constraints; and establishes control-preserving speed targets without changing scientific acceptance criteria.

## Notes

2026-08-24 deep-review measurement finding D-101: exp-007 records 3.4 wall seconds although its sequential JSONL has two ~30s candidate quenches plus other calls; exp-008 aggregate is also below retained per-call sums. Treat historical round-level wall_seconds as untrusted for map pricing until reconstructed or remeasured with current receipts.
