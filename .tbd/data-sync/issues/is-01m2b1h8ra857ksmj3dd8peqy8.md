CAL-5 from the Astra Max source-distinct review. The supervisor publishes calibration-passed before its final readback and deadline check; KeyboardInterrupt at that boundary leaves a false terminal success, and unbounded observer/readback calls sit outside the measured lifetime. Keep the receipt nonterminal through bounded readback and observation, make final success the last transaction, retain complete admission duration, and test interruption and expiry at the boundary. This blocks calibration admission.

## Notes

Astra Max source-distinct review at b6260970 refuses CAL-5 on one remaining P2. Real SIGINT during either tempfile.mkstemp acquisition can arrive after the OS creates a .result-admission-* file but before _stage_result owns the returned path, leaking the file and descriptor. The supervisor records partial and redelivers SIGINT, but the retained-artifact reader rejects that directory. Sol is repairing both acquisition windows with real synchronized regression coverage. No profile or BC329 target ran.
