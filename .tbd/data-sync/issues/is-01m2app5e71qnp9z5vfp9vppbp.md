Add a maintained calibrate_fixed_core_packet command with strict fixed-core-packet-calibration/v1 receipt semantics. It must remain outside the BC329 scientific state machine, use a frozen analytically solved positive fixture, call the real raw, normalized-exact, reflected-interval, dilation, publication, and strict per-direction readback kernels, and never emit packet-accepted or scientific evidence. Freeze and independently verify the fixture argument and exact answers; preserve truthful fixture provenance rather than T025 ancestry. Add cross-schema refusal, known-answer, row/witness mutation, source-separation, byte-binding, lifecycle, and metrics controls. Do not run the BC329 source or target.
